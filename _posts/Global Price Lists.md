Ever been told by a sales person you what discount you where getting? Been told you were getting a better discount than sometime before? Beeng told you were getting a discount because it was end of month, quarter, year? 

Even more fun, ever been told by your boss what a sales person told them that smells like BS and is being used to manipulate your boss into doing something you think they shouldn't?

How do you asses the veracity of these claims? You might think your powerless in these situations but your not, at least not as often as you might think.

Companies like EMC, Cisco, Oracle, etc. have price lists that are accessible via completley legitmate channels, though the don't usually make it easy or straight forward to find.



You should calculate the percentage discount per line item your getting for all products you purchase

The var will not likely help you and you likely shouldn't ask, it just gets awkward for them as they tend to feel like list price is privileged information, it isn't but our not going to get it without effort.

Why are these price lists available?

Often it is to satisfy a requirement for a government contract, like with a city or state government where due to the public nature of the organization they are required to publicize all contracts.

These types of organizations also tend to want to negotiated pricing on all products sold by the vendor in one shot for their entire organization.

In the case of a state there may be many different IT organizations at various levels of local government across the state but they may all be able to leverage the state level negotiated pricing without having to negotiate individually.

Since the contracts are public and these contracts include pricing for each item the vendor sells and it includes the percentage discount for these items you can then reverse engineer what the actual list price is.
