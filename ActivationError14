If you get return Code 14 try running the activation process from a system with nothing installed
Adobe reader was called out as specifcally one that might cause issues but I tried the activation from a server with only InDesign Server and it still failed
Doing it from a system with absolutely nothing installed worked.

Getting support from adobe
The first person won't know about indesign server but if you tell them that is the product you need support with they will transfer you to a team that knows that product
